# This is a starter strongSwan /etc/swanctl/conf.d/ file for
# interoperability with Windows IPsec.  The test machines must
# both be on the 10.0.0.0/8 network.  The quick mode traffic 
# selector is only for ICMP, i.e., for ping.  It only uses
# IKEv1 with a pre-shared key of "P@ssword".  
#
# On Windows, the main mode settings must be:
# 	Integrity: SHA-256
# 	Encryption: AES-CBC 256
# 	Key Exchange: Diffie-Hellman Group 14
#
# On Windows, the ESP quick mode settings must be:
# 	Encryption: AES-GCM 256
# 	Integrity: AES-GMAC 256
#
# On Windows, configure the machine-wide default auth to be:
#   Pre-Shared Key: P@ssword
#
# On Windows, set the authentication method in the IPsec connection 
# security rule to Default. Do not customize the auth settings in any
# IPsec rules, only configure auth settings in the properties of the
# firewall snap-in itself, i.e., only use machine-wide auth settings.
#
# With IKEv1, each remote_ts or local_ts may have only a single selector.
# If multiple selectors are needed, multiple children{} must be added.
# Also, every remote_ts and local_ts line must include a [protocol] of 
# some type or else Windows will reject the connection.
